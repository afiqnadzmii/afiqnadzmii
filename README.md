Iâ€™m a software engineering student and a full-time Manchester United supporter. Iâ€™m currently exploring possible career pathways I can pursue after finishing my studiesâ€”perhaps becoming a developer, IT expert, entering business, or even becoming a celebrity (who knows?). My GitHub profile reflects the small steps Iâ€™m taking to create software projects that shape who I am now and who I will be in the future.
